Principle of relativity
=======================

The principle of relativity as defined by Albert Einstein postulated
that  "Physical laws are expressed in the same way (have the same
shape) in all referentials" (inertial reference systems or not).  It
is also a principle of symmetry, or covariance.  The principle does
not mean that observers measure the same thing, but that the physical
laws that we must establish, following their transformation from a
referential to another, have the same general shape.  As the measures
are very different from an observer to another, the only invariant
measure being that of the speed light.

For economy, I extended this principle to the notion of currency:
"currency, being a universal code that governs economic exchanges,
must operate identically in all referentials",  and of value:
"everyone is free to estimate what is valuable and what is not".

In economy, any couple observator/referential is an individual in his
economic area, and the principles must be valid and of same shape,
whatever the spatio-temporal position considered.   It is therefore
also a matter of applying the first article of the human rights
charter, about equalitity of individuals before the law, applying it
not only to the code that will govern the common currency, but also to
the relative measure  of all value, which is also the understanding of
the freedom of choice of each individual for the value, as well of his
production as of his exchanges.

In other words "no individual should be privileged as to the judgment and
measure of all value".


Freedom, value, currency, referential
=====================================

It is not possible either to establish a consistent theorical body
without precising the fundamental freedoms to which it refers.  These
freedoms are absent from classical theories, for no good reason other
than they ignore them.

a) Freedom
----------

Freedom is defined as a symetry principle: (non-nuisance) make no harm
to oneself and to others .


b) Value
---------

We call value any economic good, tangible,energetic, immaterial,
spatial or temporal.  For example, you could assign a value to a
fruit, to electricity, to software, to land or to education.  The
principle of relativity denies any absolute measure of value.  Any
value fluctuates relatively to the individual who uses it, produces it
or exchanges it; thus, it is fluctuating in all space-times considered.


c) Currency
-----------

Currency is a tool for accounting and exchange, common to all the
individuals (citizens) participating in the same economic area (by
extension we will say "universal", keeping in mind that it's only
"universal" within the economic area considered).


d) Economic Area
-----------------

A currency area, (or economic area) is defined as a  sovereign space,
and its present and future citizens.  So this is a local space-time.


Axiomatic
===========

The principle of freedom must acknowledge all individuals, present and
future, and allows us to define three fundamental economic freedoms as
following:


a) Freedom of access to resources
---------------------------------

Any citizen is free to access resources.


b) Freedom of production
------------------------

Any citize is free to produce value.


c) Freedom of exchange "in the currency"
----------------------------------------

Any citizen is free to exchange with others "in the currency".


| Freedom being defined as non-nuisance, one must not make the basic
  logical error which consists to interpret the economic freedoms as a
  right to violate others' property, to produce or exchange what is
  unlawful.
| How to interpret the "freedom of access to resources"?  It must be
  interpreted in terms of non-nuisance, as specified by the Lockean
  proviso:

Once gathered (or 'appropriated'), an item belongs to the person who
made the effort to gather it, "at least where there is enough, and as
good, left in common for others"; nature itself remained common
property.  One owns the apples one picked, but not the apple tree;
the deer one hunted, but not the forest.

For example, nobody has the right to appropriate the unique water
source in a desert, without giving access to the water to everyone.


Free code and free monetary system
=====================================

Free code, as defined in the software world ("free software") consists
in giving freedoms to the users of software programs, so they may see
the source code of the software, and are able to modify it.  This
principle of "freedom of code" is fundamentally compatible with the
principle of relativity, because if the laws are independent of the
referencial, it is that they are not hidden or inaccessible thru
experimentation, wherever we are.


Now the currency is currently a hidden and privative code, in the sense
that currency is controlled by rules that cannot be modified
democratically (essentially the rules of Basel I, II and soon III,
which are in no manner established following a democratic process),
and that the transactions performed by the banking system for the
issue of asymetric credits are not transparent.  The historical
subprime crisis which saw its summit in 2008 is the latest
illustration.




According to the consequences of the "numerical perspective"[#]_
revealed by Olivier Auber, the choice of a system implies the choice
of a code which governs it, and it is not neutral.  We must ask the
question of the transparency and the legitimacy of this code.

.. [#] Perspective numérique http://perspective-numerique.net/

This implies that the code freedom which governs a system (here the
currency, code of alle conomic exchanges), is a pre-concept choice,
otherwise there would simply not be any choice, and therefore no
freedom.  According to this criterion defended by the inventor of free
software, Richard Stallman, if you use a system whose code is not
free, you deprive yourself of fundamental freedoms. 


The consequence of a monetary system whose code is hidden, is the
emergence of an economy whose value field is a pyramidal topological
structure, auto-reproductive and unstable.  On the contrary, the
consequence of using a free monetary system is the emergence of an
economy whose value field is an expanding spherical structure in the
space-time, compatible with the generation replacement.

However, the software freedoms as defined by the Free Software
Foundation (FSF), which are four in number, must be distinguished from
the freedoms of a communication protocol, or exchange, like the
currency, which cannot be modified individually without being cut out
from the community that uses it.  Thus, "Free software" respects the
following users' freedoms:

* Freedom of use
* Freedom of access to source code
* Freedom of modification of source code
* Freedom of copy

They are different from the four freedoms which must be attributed to
a free monetary system:

* Freedom of democratic modification
* Freedom of access to resources
* Freedom of production of values
* Freedom of exchange "in the currency"

Examples:  In 2011, the Euro cannot be considered a free currency,
since its code (the treaties on the European Monetary Union) are not
modifiable by a democratic process.

We can talk of Euro as a currency privative of freedom, a privative
currency system, at least in the sense of the first freedom, and even
more of the fourth freedom as we'll see later.

Another example: gold.  We may say that gold, as a candidate currency,
doesn't respect at least the third economic freedom, of exchange "in
the currency", for the simple reason ­ which we'll develop later ­
that it is not universally accessible within an economic area.  Such a
"currency" which imposes to revert to barter where it's not present,
cannot have this characterstic of freedom of exchange "in the currency".

That's why the CRT distinguishes between a specific value and the
currency "universal measure and mean of exchange" within the economic
area.

It's somewhat like the role played by the speed of light in relativist
physics.  Light is not a physical object like the others.  Its speed,
given of space/time (a distance divided by a time) is the same in all
the referencials.  And because observers agree on this point, they
deduct the relativity of the other measures to establish a relativist
theory compatible between themselves, giving different measures
depending on the referencial, but having "the same shape".


Summary
=======


So we are equipped with the following principles:

* Principle of relativity
* Freedom of democratic modification
* Freedom of access to resources
* Freedom of production
* Freedom of exchange "in the currency"
